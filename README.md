Overview:
This project demonstrates a typical DevOps workflow for deploying a Python application using Docker and Kubernetes.

Project Structure:
   Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image configuration for the Python application.
   Jenkinsfile: Jenkins pipeline script for building, pushing and deploying the application.
   app.py: Sample Python application code.
   deploy-service.yaml: Kubernetes manifest file for deploying the application.
   requirements.txt: Python dependencies required for the application.

Tools Required:
   Docker: Used to build and manage containers.
   Kubernetes: Container orchestration tool for deploying and managing containerized applications.
   Jenkins: Automation server for CI/CD pipelines.
   kubectl: Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
Jenkins Plugins:

Ensure the following plugins are installed in your Jenkins environment:

   Docker Plugin: Integrates Docker with Jenkins for building and pushing Docker images.
   Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin: Allows Jenkins to deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters.
   Credentials Plugin: Manages secrets such as DockerHub credentials and Kubernetes configuration.

Setup
Docker Setup:

   Install Docker on your local machine or CI server.
   Configure Docker Hub credentials using Jenkins Credentials Plugin.
Kubernetes Setup:

Ensure kubectl is installed and configured with the appropriate Kubernetes cluster credentials.
   Set up Kubernetes secrets or config files for accessing your cluster.

Jenkins Setup:

Install Jenkins and configure it with necessary plugins.
Set up a Jenkins pipeline job linked to your projectâ€™s Jenkinsfile.
